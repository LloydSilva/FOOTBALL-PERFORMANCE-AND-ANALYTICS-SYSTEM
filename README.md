# FOOTBALL PERFORMANCE AND ANALYTICS SYSTEM

Developed a system using MongoDB, MySQL and Python to track and analyze player performance, match details and team statistics for data-driven decision-making. Designed and optimized database queries in both SQL and NoSQL environments, comparing execution times and performance trade-offs for structured and semi-structured football data. 
Implemented advanced data processing and visualization techniques, leveraging indexing, aggregation pipelines and schema mapping to enhance query efficiency and analytical insights.
